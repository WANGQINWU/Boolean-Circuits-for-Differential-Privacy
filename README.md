# Boolean-Circuits-for-Differential-Privacy

The project develops a randomized response in boolean circuits solved via SAT problem solver engine, Z3.

In BooleanCircuit folder, there are three core classes, BC.py, BC_Stat and RRclass.py.
BC.py contains functions for generation. BC_Stat is the father class for BC.py containing iteration models function and probability calculations.
